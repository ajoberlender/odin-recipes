    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>I modified Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies very slightly. I came up with something that my boyfriend went CRAZY over! I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I blew his mother's recipe away.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p>1 cup butter, softened</p>
    <p>1 cup packed light brown sugar</p>
    <p>½ cup white sugar</p>
    <p>2 eggs</p>
    <p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
    <p>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</p>
    <p>½ teaspoon baking soda</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
    <p>3 cups quick-cooking oats</p>
    <p>1 cup chopped walnuts</p>
    <p>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</p>
    <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
    <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
    <p>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
    <p>Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

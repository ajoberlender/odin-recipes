    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>The first time I made these, I made a mess and they STILL turned out! They are gone in 2 days at my house. Simple to make and super yummy.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p>1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed</p>
    <p>3 tablespoons butter, melted</p>
    <p>⅔ cup brown sugar</p>
    <p>½ cup chopped walnuts</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</p>
    <p>⅓ cup heavy whipping cream</p>
    <p>⅔ cup sifted confectioners' sugar</p>
    <p>2 tablespoons milk</p>
    <p>1 dash vanilla extract</p>
    <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
    <p>Lightly grease 2 round cake pans with butter.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
    <p>Roll bread dough out to an 6x18-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter. Combine brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over butter. Roll dough into a log, starting at the long edge. Moisten edge with water and seal. Cut log into 20 slices; arrange rolls, cut sides down, in prepared cake pans. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 90 minutes.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour heavy cream over dough.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 5</h4></p>
    <p>Mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a small bowl; drizzle over warm cinnamon rolls to serve.</p>
    <p><h3>Cook's Note</h3></p>
    <p>I wanted the bread to hold onto the sugar and nuts and cinnamon, so I used the extra butter. Mine don't hold together very well, so I just make sure that the edges are all next to the pan or each other. I usually add extra nuts and cinnamon because my husband likes them.</p>
